## Introduction
The I-MOTION Mobility, Social, Energy & Location Analytics application efficiently gathers raw sensor data from mobile devices, which is then sent to the IMOTION back-end system. 
Here, the data undergoes processing to construct partial journeys, which are composed of either solely tracks or tracks combined with stays. 
Tracks represent movements from one origin to a destination via a specific mode of transport, while stays represent periods of stationary activity, each with a distinct purpose.

This application serves a wide range of uses within the mobility sector. 
For instance, it provides detailed mobility data essential for transportation planning. 
By analyzing this data, planners can assess the usage of the transport network, evaluate the efficiency of existing infrastructure, manage passenger flows more effectively, and design innovative mobility services. 
Utilizing this application allows for the optimization of timetables and routes, expansion of transport services, and enhancement of passenger attraction efforts.
