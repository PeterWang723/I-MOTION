\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
Contemporary urban system research is undergoing a profound change, which is mainly driven by the popularization of mobile technology. The inherent capabilities of mobile devices open up new avenues for data collection, allowing researchers to delve into the complexities of human behavior in urban environments. This paradigm shift highlights the need for innovative approaches to collecting and analyzing data, especially in areas such as travel patterns, time allocation, and integration of digital activities.\newline

The motivation for this report stems from an awareness of the changing research environment and the urgent need to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the field. Traditional methods of data collection, while valuable, often fail to capture the dynamic nature of human behavior in urban environments. Leveraging mobile platforms is a promising solution that provides real-time insights into how individuals navigate physical and digital Spaces, allocate time, and perceive productivity in different contexts.
\section{Objectives}
The project outlined in the report aims to address existing gaps in mobile data collection platforms by introducing new capabilities tailored to the specific needs of Imperial's Urban Systems Lab. By developing a new mobile platform-based time use and travel data collection platform, it aims to improve the breadth and depth of data available for interdisciplinary research efforts. This effort is driven by the desire to explore new dimensions of human behavior, from the modes of transportation used to the subtle interplay between physical and digital activities.\newline

In addition, the report aims to advance theoretical understanding and practical applications in the areas of urban planning, transportation, economics and public health. The insights gained from the data collected by the proposed platform have the potential to inform policy decisions, influence the development of urban infrastructure, and help create more livable and sustainable cities.\newline

The specific objectives of the application includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item sensing motion of the device, to support inference of mode of transport
  \item incorporation of location-based capabilities and map-matching
  \item monitoring of app usage and data consumption
  \item Rule-driven user prompt (for data verification and manual inputs)
  \item Gathering of data from the associated wearable technologies
\end{itemize}
Fundamentally, this report is born out of a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of mobile technology to revolutionize the way we study and understand urban systems. By pushing the limits of data collection capabilities and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, we hope to gain new insights that will drive positive change in the global urban environment.

\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Overview of Traditional Survey Methods}
Historically, traffic data collection has relied primarily on traditional survey methods such as paper diaries and telephone interviews. These methods are fundamental to understanding travel behavior, but are limited by their reliance on participants' memory and honesty. This is particularly pronounced in the elderly population, where cognitive impairment can affect the accuracy of self-reported data. Traditional methods also often suffer from low response rates and heavy participant burdens, which can skew results and limit their applicability in dynamic traffic modeling.
\section{Introduction of Future Mobility Sensing (FMS)}
FMS is a platform that collects and visualizes data by using mobile sensing technology, machine learning algorithms, and user verification to accurately record and present detailed travel and activity data. The development of future mobility sensing (FMS) technology marks a major shift in the way traffic data is collected, particularly the convergence of smartphone technology with location-based data collection. FMS utilizes GPS, GSM, Wi-Fi and accelerometers to collect high-resolution objective data on travel patterns and behavior in real time. This technique not only improves the accuracy of the data, but also reduces the recall bias associated with traditional surveys.

\end{figure}
\section{Architecture of FMS}
The FMS system (Figure \ref{figure:1}) consists of three interrelated parts. It includes a mobile app or tracking device equipped with various sensing technologies to collect data. The backend of the system is a server with a database and custom algorithms to infer the details of the trip, such as the trip site, mode and purpose, thereby reducing the burden on the user. In addition, a user interface accessible through mobile phones and web platforms allows participants to verify their activities. With validation, more information can be gathered and comprehensive data can be displayed. Users can visually see their daily trips and activities on a geo-plotted timeline and can also confirm trips automatically detected by the system.
\section{Comparative Advantages of FMS}
FMS offers several distinct advantages over traditional methods, particularly in terms of data quality and participant burden. For example, in the Future Mobility Survey conducted in Singapore, the use of smartphones enabled continuous tracking of travel activity without the need for active user input for each trip. This approach not only minimizes recall errors, but also greatly reduces the workload of participants, potentially increasing response rates and the richness of the collected data.\newline

As demonstrated in the Singapore study, the integration of FMS with traditional survey frameworks demonstrates its ability to enhance the data collection process. It provides a powerful platform for tracking detailed travel trails, patterns and duration, which is critical for developing more accurate traffic models and solutions.
\section{FMS and Elder Populations}
For the elderly, FMS is particularly beneficial. Due to the blank recall and the fragmented nature of travel patterns, traditional methods often fail to fully reflect the travel challenges faced by older people. FMS's real-time data collection can address these issues, providing more accurate and timely data to better analyze older users' travel needs and obstacles.
\section{Future Directions and Improvements}
While FMS has made welcome progress in travel data collection, its implementation is not without challenges. Issues such as digital literacy among the elderly, privacy concerns, and the widespread use of smartphones are all barriers that need to be addressed. Future research could focus on improving user interfaces for seniors, strengthening data privacy protections, and integrating FMS with other data sources to create comprehensive, user-friendly mobile tracking systems.
